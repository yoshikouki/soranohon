# Coding Conventions

## Package by Feature Guidelines
- Each feature should be self-contained in its own directory under `src/features/`
- Avoid cross-feature dependencies - use shared components/utilities instead
- Keep feature-specific code within the feature directory
- Only UI components should be separated into a `components/` directory
- Business logic, types, and utilities should live directly in the feature directory
- If code is used by multiple features, consider moving it to shared components/lib

## Feature Organization
- Keep UI components in `components/` directory
- Place business logic in appropriately named files (e.g., `auth.ts`, `votes.ts`)
- Group related types in `types.ts`
- Place feature-specific utilities in `utils.ts`
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Consider splitting files if they grow too large or handle multiple concerns

## Business Logic Guidelines
- Business logic belongs in the feature's `models/` directory
- Domain models should be clearly defined and typed
- Keep business logic separate from utilities and UI components
- Business logic should not depend on UI components
- Business logic can depend on utilities, but not vice versa

## TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow strict type checking rules as defined in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Keep types close to where they are used (in the feature directory)

## Code Quality
- Code formatting and linting is handled by Biome as configured in [biome.json](mdc:biome.json)
- Use CSpell for spell checking as configured in [.cspell.json](mdc:.cspell.json)

## Component Structure
- Shared components go in `src/components/`
- Feature-specific components go in `features/[feature]/components/`
- Each component should have:
  - Main component file (kebab-case.tsx)
  - Associated test file (kebab-case.test.ts)
  - Any component-specific utilities

## Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Test files should be co-located with the code they test
- Use Vitest for testing as configured in [vitest.config.ts](mdc:vitest.config.ts)

## File Naming
- Use kebab-case for all files
- React Components: `component-name.tsx`
- Hooks: `use-hook-name.ts`
- Utils: `util-name.ts`
- Next.js special files: Follow Next.js conventions (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`)

## Imports
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for shared code
- Use relative imports for code within the same feature
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. External dependencies
  2. Shared modules (@/components/*, @/lib/*)
  3. Feature-specific imports (relative)
  4. Types and interfaces
